# Louise Lee Portfolio

## Next Steps
* Seeing 2 "problems" in termal, but cannot identify the issues.
* Update with ongoing concepts

## Goals & Motivation
The purpose of this project is to introduce myself, display completed coding projects and to highlight accomplishments to become a Fully-Stacked Programmer.

### Minimum Requirements
* Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site containing 3 pages (index, about, portfolio) including the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

   * Must use semantic html.

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

* Screenshots are provided as a reference in the `Assets/Images` folder. Your app does not need to be _exactly_ like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

#### Bonus--Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).
